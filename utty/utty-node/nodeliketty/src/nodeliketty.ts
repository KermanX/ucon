   * It is possible to pass in an `env` object to simulate the usage of a specific
   * terminal. This can be useful to check how specific environment settings behave.
   *
   * To enforce a specific color support, use one of the below environment settings.
   *
   * * 2 colors: `FORCE_COLOR = 0` (Disables colors)
   * * 16 colors: `FORCE_COLOR = 1`
   * * 256 colors: `FORCE_COLOR = 2`
   * * 16,777,216 colors: `FORCE_COLOR = 3`
   *
   * Disabling color support is also possible by using the `NO_COLOR` and`NODE_DISABLE_COLORS` environment variables.
   * @since v9.9.0
   * @param [env=process.env] An object containing the environment variables to check. This enables simulating the usage of a specific terminal.
